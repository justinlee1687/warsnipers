CLAN RULES:


English language in chat.
Everyone needs 1 000 donations & 1 000 requests MINIMUM every season. No ratio. 
Clan Games participation is mandatory - 500 points minimum.
Read all clan mails thoroughly and act accordingly.
Do not donate any troops to the clan war clan castles.
If you are going to be inactive for a short or long period of time, notify a leader through Discord or ingame. If you get to 3 strikes you will be kicked to make way for new members.
Leaving the clan without asking any leader/co-leader will make you not accepted back and may get you banned. 




Strike System:

Clan members get 3 STRIKES before they are kicked
Strikes can be cleared by helping the clan with cleanup during war. You can attack the bases which have not been correctly attacked (i.e. 2 starred in a win war) once the person who is responsible for attacking that base has finished attacking it. 
In the last 6 hours of war you may attack any unattacked base for the correct number of stars.
Strikes get removed after 4 days without any new added strikes. (1 less strike every 4 days) 


1 STRIKE:
1 strike for failure to attack in war, with the exception if you notified a leader ahead of time.
1 strike for attacking the wrong base


2 STRIKES:
2 strikes for failure to follow war plan, example - 3 starring in a loss.
Not fixing errors in the active FWA base after being notified (e.g. Air X-Bows, range overlaps etc).
2 strikes for hitting #1&2 when you're not supposed to.
2 strikes for failure to hit the minimum donation/request per season.
2 strikes for not getting 500 clan game points.


3 STRIKES (INSTA-KICK):
3 strikes for not having a FWA base up.
3 strikes for donating troops to FWA Clan Castles.


Leaders have the right to overrule  the strike system and act as they think is more appropriate. The system will be followed in most “normal” situations.

Password to join the clan (and show you have read the rules): December.


FWA match rules:
Before every FWA war a clan mail will be sent whether that war is a win or a loss. Members must follow the attack rules explained in the clan mail. Here’s a quick summary:

War win:
1st attack on mirror (same number as you) for 3 stars
2nd attack on any of the top 10 bases for one star
6 hours left of war day any base is open for 3 stars.



War loss:
1st attack on mirror (same number as you) for 2 stars (NO 3 Stars at all)
2nd attack on any of the top 10 bases for one star
6 hours left of war day any base is open for 2 stars.



Mismatch/blacklist:
Follow clan mails for the strategy.
Note: If you attack late in war and your mirror has been attacked as part of cleanup, your 1st attack should always be on your mirror and then proceed with either 1 star attack for loot or cleanup if available. 


CWL:
The plan is for us to create a throwaway clan so we can join and participate in both CWL and FWA wars. We will be keeping FWA BASES active for the entirety of CWL. You will have to hop between the main clan and the throwaway clan to do your CWL attack and your FWA attacks. We will have to be very coordinated with what we are doing, so we will have a CWL channel on Discord to help everyone with the transitions. (See clan announcement channel after being accepted for more details)

Clan rank and benefits:

We are always looking for active players to help manage the clan.
Promotions are considered after you have been with the clan for 2 months and are based on your activity and willingness to help us out in the clan/Discord server with recruitment, helping new players adjust to FWA rules and generally putting the clan first. Good war attacks/donations are also a plus.
 If you’re someone who simply wants to enjoy the game and doesn’t want to have any obligations, you’re free to keep doing so but promotions won’t be given.


Promotion to elder:
Elder is for players who want to help the Co / Leaders with the recruitment process for our clans and help audit bases. You will need to be active on Discord and also have experience with using Discord or willing to learn.

Elder Tasks:
Help new members adjust to FWA rules/wars
Audit bases so we are ready for war
Helping out in our entry channel - If you joined through Discord you know the drill, training and guidance will be given if needed.

Elder Benefits
 Access to the Elders chat for quicker reply to any questions you may have.
 May be allowed to get an alt in our clan. If the leader agrees only.         


Promotion to Co-Leader:
Are you interested in helping run the clan as a Co-Leader?


Benefits of being a Co-leader:
Donation / Received requirements don’t apply to you.
Most strike offences do not apply as long as you are performing tasks required.

What we are looking for:
You must be active (In Game and on Discord)
Show leadership (Help those who need it in the clan and show you are capable of helping lead the clan)


Some tasks we are expecting you to do are:
Start war syncs - BAND app required
Participate in our Co-leader chat re: the clan and any rule changes, clan talk, etc.
Help out Elders with base audits and new members.
