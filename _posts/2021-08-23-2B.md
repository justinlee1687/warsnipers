## What is expected of me as a member of the clan?
### 1. Must follow rules regarding donations/requests:
{:.no_toc}
- Members must donate a minimum of <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">1300</span> troops and receive a minimum of <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">1300</span> troops per season.
- Members at <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">Town Hall 11</span> must donate a minimum of <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">1000</span> troops and receive a minimum of <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">1000</span> troops per season.
- Clashperk's <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">/donations</span> in #ws2x-bot will be used to determine your donations each season.
- **Read the troop request text carefully before donating.** If there is a request for “Any” or other non-specific requests, you can donate any troop except regular goblins, healers, or any type of wall breakers. They should only be donated if specifically requested.
- Try not to be too picky when requesting, so everyone can donate and you can get your donation quicker. You should avoid using raid medals for requests unless no one else is online or you're bypassing the request cooldown.
- **We do not enforce any Donation/Request ratio.** So long as you are meeting the donation requirement, you may request as much as you want. (The clan leader reserves the right to ask you to improve your donation ratio if deemed necessary.)
- If you mistakenly donated a wrong troop, own up immediately in chat. If you receive a troop not in your request, report immediately in chat, regardless of whether you can identify the donator.

Minimums are intended to be exceeded, Leadership reserves the right to remove any member who is only doing the bare minimum should the clan need to adjust its war weight or open up a spot.
{: .notice--info}

### 2. Must use ALL Clan Capital attacks during the Raid Weekend.
{:.no_toc}
- Make sure you attack in the first 63 hours to avoid having your spot taken by an alt.
- You may bring in alts temporarily to contribute capital gold at any time, but you may not attack on them until the last **9 hours** of the Raid Weekend to give everyone a fair chance to attack.
- Use of the Forge is appreciated, but *NOT REQUIRED*.

###### 2a. Raid Weekend Rules.
{:.no_toc}
- Please use all of your attacks, so all 6 attacks. You will be striked if you do not use 6/6 attacks.
- You will be able to obtain an extra attack on top of your 5 attacks when you triple a base. So in total you will have 6 attacks. (if the sword will turned gold, you have got the extra attack)
- **NEVER END BATTLES!!** If you run out of time and still have attacks left please finish off the base.

Please be attentive to other clanmates, if someone is attacking a base do not snipe it and let them finish it off. If unclear you could ask ingame/discord chat. Or check if they have used up all their attacks already.
{: .notice--info}

### 3. Must earn a minimum of 1000 points from the monthly Clan Games.
{:.no_toc}

### 4. Must use both attacks in FWA wars as directed by the clan mail.
{:.no_toc}
+  **WIN war:**
1st attack: 3 star your mirror <br>
2nd attack: 1 star any base or wait for cleanup <br>
Cleanup: 4 hours before war ends for unattacked bases, or anytime, when incorrectly attacked **OR** If all bases have already been cleared, see cleanup section below.
+ **LOSE war:**
1st attack: 2 star your mirror <br>
2nd attack: 1 star any base or wait for cleanup <br>
Cleanup: 4 hours before war ends for unattacked bases, or anytime, when incorrectly attacked **OR**  If all bases have already been cleared, see cleanup section below.
+ **Cleanups:**
Cleanups are optional. <br>
Cleanups are when you can hit other unattacked bases after the specified hour. <br>
If YOUR mirror is taken, you may hit another base that was incorrectly attacked/has not been hit yet for your first attack. Second attack as normal OR cleanup another base. <br>
If all bases are all cleared, <span style="color:#B22222; font-weight:bold">DO NOT hit 1 and 2</span>, you should hit your mirror as your first attack and second attack as normal.

### 4a. Make sure you use a proper strategy when attacking for 3 stars
{:.no_toc}
- You may receive a warning or strike if you fail your mirror attack repeatedly without notifying the leader.
- If you're unsure how to 3 star a FWA base effectively and efficiently, watch your other clanmates replays, and if necessary, request a friendly challenge so you can practice.
- Repeatedly over or understarring will result in strikes and an eventual removal from the clan.

### 4b. On a Non-FWA war (*Blacklisted clan or Mismatch*):
{:.no_toc}
- **On a blacklisted war:**
 - **Switch to REAL war base** during Prep Day, **switch back to FWA** once War Day has started.
 - Use resources posted in the clan announcements channel on Discord, if available.
 - **Use both attacks** to claim 2 or 3 stars from war bases as directed in the announcements channel.
- **On a mismatch war:**
  Follow all clan mail sent through Discord and in-game. The clan mails will decide on whether or not we switch to war bases. **(Do not switch bases unless instructed to via discord or clan mail.)**

### 5. Must notify leadership BEFORE leaving the clan or going inactive.
{:.no_toc}
+ Regardless of reason, you must notify leadership in a DM (Direct Message) to the Leader **at least 2 days in advance.**
	- The maximum amount of time you may be inactive without losing your spot is **10 days**. If you have not given notice within this time, you may be removed from the clan at any time and without further warning.
	- If you leave the clan to join another without giving notice, you will not be able to rejoin the clan quickly later, and may be banned from rejoining entirely.
+ You may be eligible for an exemption of clan requirements if you inform in advance.

### 6. Exercise 'Common Sense'
{:.no_toc}
+ Do not donate to the war clan castles or switch to a real war base during FWA wars or CWL.
+ Do not 3 star in loss wars or take full stars from another members mirror before cleanup time.
+ Do not use game modifications or external tools/bots on your account.
+ Avoid using online services such as 'cheap gem' sellers, account boosters, or similar, as they can steal your account and your money.
+ Do not share access to your Clash of Clans account or Discord account with anyone, even friends or family. You are responsible for any actions taken through your account.
+ Do not try to buy or sell game accounts through any clan chats.
+ Do not share links or details of ToS breaking activity in any clan chats.
+ Remain civil and avoid using excessive amounts of vulgar language when interacting with your clanmates.
+ Always use English in clan chat.


## What is the Strike System?
- Clan members get 4 strikes before they are put on the kick list.
- Strikes are available in the clan specific channel for strikes. You will be tagged when a new strike is added. You can also run !strikes to check your own strikes at anytime.
- Strikes reset monthly after season reset. Donation/Request related strikes of the next month are accounted for in the previous season before resetting to prevent members from slacking with d/r repeatedly.
  - For example, you have 2 strikes in Jan 2022 for missing both d and r minimum. In Feb 2022, you only got 1 strike for only missing d minimum but got 1 strike for missing war. You will have 4 strikes at the end of feb, with only the donation strike carrying to march.
- Please note we only use strikes as a reference point to gauge inactivity. Leadership reserves to have the right to remove any member if they are deemed to be doing the minimum continuously, if the member is not being a team player or if they're the most inactive out of their respective townhall and is affecting FWA matchmaking.

### Strikes are given for:

- Not attacking in war.
- Not attacking mirror first.

## I want to participate in CWL, where and how can I do that?
Our clan works with a few other clans in our discord to organize CWL in new separate clans. This allows us to run Lazy CWL at the same time as our FWA wars. Spots in CWL are first come, first served. Details for the current season will be announced by @Justin in the clan announcements channel on Discord. Enabling push notifications for that channel is recommended.

Interested members must thoroughly read the following document: [CWL Guidelines and Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.warsnipers.com/cwl "You agree to follow these rules whether you have read them or not" ). Once the announcement has been posted, you will need to join one of the clans in the message within 24 hours of it being posted. Throughout the week, you will hop to your CWL clan (Bookmark it!) for attacks then immediately return to the main clan.

CWL participation is an optional perk for clan members, but it is also a privilege. Members may be banned from CWL or removed from the clan for any of the following reasons:
- Joining but not attacking in CWL, leading to a wasted spot
- Lingering excessively in the CWL clan
- Attacking improperly in CWL
- Having a REAL war base set at any time
- Leaving for CWL after FWA war has ended and missing sync

We do not allow members to do CWL with outside clans. If you intend to leave for your own CWL you will lose your spot and have to reapply. There is no guarantee that you will be able to get back into one of our clans right away following the end of CWL, especially if you demonstrate that you will leave every season.

Basic Guidelines:
1. We will be doing CWL and regular FWA wars at the same time so you need to keep your FWA war base active AT ALL TIME.
2. You will be hopping between the clans to do your FWA and CWL attacks and make sure you join back before each FWA sync.
3. It is YOUR responsibility to make sure you don't miss any regular FWA sync. DO NOT LEAVE CLAN BETWEEN FWA WAR ENDS & NEXT SYNC!
4. Stay in WS most of the time and ONLY go to CWL clan to do attacks. DO NOT STAY IN CWL CLAN.
5. To get the max amount of medals, you'll need to score at least 8 stars over 7 wars
6. Hit your mirror. The only exception is if the base is already attacked by the mirror and you want to attack it again.


## Who are the clans leaders and how can I reach them?
**[Lead] Justin (Justin#1676)** is the clan leader.

The best way to contact leadership is to @ mention their Discord username in the discord clan specific chat. Try not to private message them directly unless it is private matter.

This is the quickest way to get an answer to any questions you may have. Messages posted in in-game chat will be missed.


## I'm interested in helping out the clan as an Elder or Co, what do I need to know?
If you are interested, feel free to private message Justin after you've been in the clan for 3-6 months and have shown to be stable and active. When you DM, include what time zone you are in as well as saying what the current time is for you. You should also include anything else you think we will need to convince us you would be a good candidate for Elder or Co-leader.

Players who are getting noticed as actively requesting and donating will be promoted to Elder during CWL week to help.

As an elder:
- When you're online, please accept any members returning from CWL who have included "back" "cwl" or similar in their join request.
- Do not invite any players who are not members of the clan without permission.
- Never EVER kick a player, please report any issues directly to leadership and allow them to handle any situations that arise.

Promotion to Co:
- You must be a stable and active member who has been with the clan for a minimum of 3-6 months.
- You must be regularly active in and participate as a part of the community on Discord.
  - Handling new recruits in the Discord entry process and redirecting join requests ingame to our Discord.
  - Participate in our Elders chat on Discord. Important information and changes will be posted there.
- You must demonstrate the ability to reliably respond to messages and DMs quickly, within reason.

Promotion to FWA Rep:
- Must be willing to install and use the app BAND
- Must be available to start wars across a range of times
- Must not leak FWA sync times to non-reps
- Participate in our Co-leader chat re: the clan and any rule changes, clan talk, etc.


## Can I bring an alt to the clan?
Members may be allowed to bring in an alt by the discretion of leadership. The minimum requirements are as follows:
  + You must be in the clan for an extended time, alts will generally not be taken on first join or within the first month of membership.
  + You must be in good standing with the clan. If you have not met the activity requirements or have missed too many wars in the past few seasons, you will not be allowed to bring in an alt.
  + Your account must meet the eligibility requirements set by the server.
  + Your alt will be subject to the same activity requirements as your main. Either account may be removed from the clan if it is not meeting the requirements.
