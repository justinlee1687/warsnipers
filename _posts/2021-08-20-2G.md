# What is expected of me as a member of the clan?

1. 	**All members must request a minimum of 1000 troops per season.**	
	- Members at *Town Hall 11* and *Town Hall 12* must **donate a minimum of 500 troops per season.**
	- Members at *Town Hall 13* and *Town Hall 14* must **donate a minimum of 1000 troops per season.**

	- **Please be specific with your troop requests.** If you do not wish to use the in-game feature to request a specific composition, you may list the troops you want or ask for “Any Ground” or “Any Air”. If at all possible, please do not request just any! If you choose to do so, you may recieve any unit, even ones you may not want.
	
	- **We do not enforce any Donation/Request ratio.** So long as you are meeting the donation requirement, you may request as much as you want.

2. Must earn a minimum of 500 points from the monthly Clan Games.

3. Must follow war attacking instructions and attack as directed by the clan mail.
	+  **On a win war:**
		- **First Attack:** *Three star mirror*
		- **Second Attack:** *Loot any base for 1 or 2 stars* OR *Wait until 8 hours or less remain to cleanup for 3 stars*
		- **If attacking late (Less than 8h remaining):** *Three star any base that has not already been 3 starred* OR If all bases have already been cleared, *Attack mirror for 3 stars anyway, loot as normal*

	+  **On a loss war:**
		- **First Attack:** *Two star mirror*
		- **Second Attack:** *Loot any base for 1 star* OR *Wait until 8 hours or less remain to cleanup for 2 stars*
		- **If attacking late (Less than 8h remaining):** *Two star any base that has not already been 2 starred* OR If all bases have already been cleared, *Attack mirror for 2 stars anyway, loot as normal*

	+ **On a blacklisted or mismatched war:**
		- **Switch to REAL war base** during Prep Day, **switch back to FWA** once War Day has started.
		- Use resources posted in the Discord 2.G Announcenents channel, if available.
		- **Use both attacks** to claim 2 or 3 stars from war bases as directed in the announcements channel.

	+ Failing war attacks due to disconnections will not be counted against you, however failing due to bringing an improper army will. If you're unsure how to 3 star a FWA base effectively and efficiently, watch your other clanmates replays, and if necessary, request a friendly challenge so you can practice.
		- Repeatedly over or understarring will result in removal from the clan.
	
4. Must notify leadership if unable to play Clash for any period of time.
	+ Regardless of reason, you must notify leadership in #ws2g-chat on discord or in a DM (Direct Message) to the Leader, if you're more comfortable doing that.
		- Preferably, please give notice in advance if possible.
		- You may remain in the clan and will be excused if you will be or have been inactive for less than 10 days.
		- If you will be inactive for longer than 10 days, you may lose your spot.
		- If you have been inactive without notice for an extended period of time, you may be removed from the clan at any time and without warning, by the discretion of leadership.

5. Must follow all applicable rules and Terms of Services for Discord and Supercell in-game and in the server while you are a member of the clan.
	+ Toxicity and harrasment of any form will not be tolerated.
	+ Discussing the use of Game Modifications, Bots, or other external tools that give players an unfair advantage through ingame chat, our Discord server, or in direct messages on discord or other platforms is explicitly forbidden.
	+ Likewise, the use of any such third party tools is also banned, and any member found using them is subject to removal to the clan.

> You may DM it to me now, or read on for CWL information.

# I want to participate in SCCWL, where and how can I do that?
Our clan works with a couple other clans in our discord to organize CWL in seperate clans. This allows us to run Lazy CWL at the same time as our FWA wars. Spots in CWL are first come, first served. Details for the current season will be announced by @Justin in the ws2g-announcements channel on Discord. Enabling push notifications for that channel is recommended.

Interested members must thoroughly read the following document: [CWL Guidelines and Frequently Asked Questions](https://tiny.cc/cwlhelp "You agree to follow these rules whether you have read them or not" ). Once the announcement has been posted, you will need to join one of the clans in the message within 24 hours of it being posted. Throughout the week, you will hop to your CWL clan (Bookmark it!) for attacks then immediately return to the main clan.

CWL participation is an optional perk for clan members, but it is also a privilege. Members may be banned from CWL for any of the following reasons:
- Joining but not attacking in CWL, leading to a wasted spot.
- Lingering excessively in the CWL clan.
- Attacking improperly in CWL.
- Having a REAL war base set at any time.
- Going over to the CWL clan without finishing your FWA attacks.

**No member may leave for CWL after FWA war has ended in the main clan.** Missing sync multiple times WILL result in permanent removal from the clan.

You may participate in CWL with your own clan, however there are conditions.
- You must be in good standing with the clan.
- Your FWA base must be left up for the whole duration of CWL. **Real War Bases are NOT ALLOWED**, You will be kicked instantly if you set one.
- Must spend most of your time in the main clan, only hopping to your CWL clan for CWL attacks, then returning immediately.
- Must not miss any FWA attacks during the week.

If you decide to do CWL with a war base anyway you will lose your spot. There is no guarantee that you will be able to get back into one of our clans right away following the end of CWL. Especially if you demonstrate that you will leave every season.

# Who are the clans leaders and how can I reach them?

[Lead] WilliamLC (WilliamLC#8374), [Lead] Justin (Justin#1676), and [Co] Queen Do / Interesse (petervdb#0348)

The best way to contact leadership is to @ mention their Discord username in #ws2g-chat or message them directly.

This is the quickest way to get an answer to any questions you may have. Most messages in in-game chat will be missed.

# I'm interested in helping out the clan as an Elder or Co, what do I need to know?
Players who are getting noticed as actively requesting and donating will be promoted to Elder mostly during CWL week.

As an elder:
- When you're online, please accept any members returning from CWL who have included "back" "cwl" or similar in their join request.
- Do not invite any players who are not members of the clan without permission.
- Never EVER kick a player, please report any issues directly to leadership and allow them to handle any situations that arise.
	
Promotion to Co:
- You must be a stable and active member who has been with the clan for a minimum of 3-6 months.
- You must be regularly active in and participate as a part of the community on Discord.
- You must demonstrate the ability to reliably respond to messages and DMs quickly, within reason.
	
Promotion to FWA Rep:
- Must be willing to install and use the app BAND
- Must be available to start wars across a range of times
- Must not leak FWA sync times to non-reps

# I would like to bring an alt account into the clan
Members may be allowed to bring in an alt by the discretion of leadership. The minimum requirements are as follows:
+ You must be in the clan for an extended time, alts will generally not be taken on first join or within the first month of membership.
+ You must be in good standing with the clan. If you have not met the activity requirements or have missed too many wars in the past few seasons, you will not be allowed to bring in an alt.
+ Your account must meet the eligibility requirements set by the server (currently TH11+, max TH10 troops, 15k Friend in Need, not-overly-rushed defenses)
+ Your alt will be subject to the same activity requirements as your main. Either account may be removed from the clan if it is not meeting the requirements.
