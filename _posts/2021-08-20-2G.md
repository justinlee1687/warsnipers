# What is expected of me as a member of the clan?

### 1. All Members must reach and exceed minimum troop donation and request requirements.
{:.no_toc}
- Clashperks <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">/donations</span> command in #ws2g-bot is be used to determine your stats each season.
  - Combined total of troops donated and requested must exceed <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">3000</span> per season
  - Troops donated must exceed <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">1000</span> per season
- **We do not enforce any Donation/Request ratio.** All members are encouraged to request as much as possible.
- **Do not post empty troop requests.** Make donating easier for your clanmates by asking for what you need.

Members doing the bare minimum may at the discretion of leadership be removed from the clan at any time if a spot needs to be opened up.
{: .notice--info}

### 2. Use ALL Clan Capital attacks during the Raid Weekend.
{:.no_toc}
+ **Members must finish attacking a district before starting a new one.** Never leave a district at a high percentage if you have attacks remaining, **clean up your mess.**
+ Members with alts may join to use attacks in the last **24 hours** of the Raid Weekend.

If other players are online attacking districts, coordinate with them in chat. Always ask before attacking a district someone else has started.
{: .notice--info}

### 3. Use both attacks in FWA wars as directed by the clan mail.
{:.no_toc}
+ **Attack your mirror within the first 16 hours of war day.**
	- Always check the clan mails and **scout the opponents base** before attacking.
	- After 16 hours have elapsed, you are considered late and your mirror can be claimed by any other member.
	- If you've logged in late and your mirror has already been attacked, use your first attack on a base that has not already been cleared for **3 stars** (*in a win*) or **2 stars** (*in a loss*), then loot or cleanup with your second attack as normal.
		- <span style="color:#B22222; font-weight:bold">Never use both attacks to loot.</span> One of your attacks must always be used to claim stars as instructed by the clan mail.
		- If all bases have been cleared, *attack your mirror anyway*.
+ **Cleanup time starts at the 8 hours remaining mark**
	- At this time, you may use your second attack on a base that has not already been cleared for **3 stars** (*in a win*) or **2 stars** (*in a loss*)
	- The mirrors of co/lead filler accounts as well members who have been kicked from the clan or are taking a break may be cleaned up **at any time**.

### 3a. Double check mails and be mindful when attacking in war
{:.no_toc}
- Make sure you are bringing a proper army into battle when attacking for 3 stars.
  - If you're unsure how to 3 star a FWA base effectively and efficiently, watch your other clanmates replays, and if necessary, request a friendly challenge so you can practice.
  - You may receive a warning or strike if you fail your mirror attack repeatedly without notifying a co or lead.
- **Pay attention** when attacking for 1 or 2 stars to avoid overstarring.

### 4. Earn a minimum of 500 points from the monthly Clan Games.
{:.no_toc}

### 5. Notify leadership BEFORE leaving the clan or going inactive.
{:.no_toc}
- Regardless of reason, you must notify leadership in a DM (Direct Message) to the Leader **at least 2 days in advance.**
  - We ask all members taking a break or looking to leave to remain in the clan until leadership can find a recruit to take their spot. No further activity is expected or required during this time.
- The maximum amount of time you may be inactive without losing your spot is **10 days** or 5 consecutive missed wars. If you have not given notice within this time, you may be removed from the clan at any time and without further warning.
	- A longer grace period is available for members in good standing upon notice of device damage, trips, exams, changes in work schedule, natural disasters, illness or injury.
  - If you leave the clan to join another without giving notice, you will not be able to rejoin the clan quickly later, and may be banned from rejoining entirely.

### 6. Exercise 'Common Sense'
{:.no_toc}
+ Do not donate to the war clan castles or switch to a real war base during FWA wars or CWL.
+ Do not use game modifications or external tools/bots on your account.
+ Do not use online services like 'cheap gem' sellers, account boosters, or similar services that are against Supercell ToS.
+ Do not try to buy or sell game accounts through any clan chats or Direct Messages.
+ Do not share access to your Clash of Clans account or Discord account with anyone, even friends or family. You are responsible for any actions taken through your account.
+ Do not share links or details of ToS breaking activity in any clan chats.
+ Remain civil and avoid using excessive amounts of vulgar language when interacting with your clanmates.

# I want to participate in SCCWL, where and how can I do that?
Our clan works with a few other clans in our discord to organize CWL in new separate clans. This allows us to run Lazy CWL at the same time as our FWA wars. Spots in CWL are first come, first served. Details will be announced by @Justin in the ws2g-announcements channel on Discord. Enabling push notifications for that channel is recommended.

Interested members must thoroughly read the following document: [CWL Guidelines and Frequently Asked Questions](/cwl "You agree to follow these rules whether you have read them or not" ). Once the announcement has been posted, you will need to join one of the clans in the message within 24 hours of it being posted. Throughout the week, you will hop to your CWL clan (Bookmark it!) for attacks then immediately return to the main clan.

CWL participation is an optional perk for clan members, but it is also a privilege. Members may be banned from CWL or removed from the clan for any of the following reasons:
- Joining but not attacking in CWL, leading to a wasted spot
- Lingering excessively in the CWL clan
- Attacking improperly in CWL
- Having a REAL war base set at any time
- Leaving for CWL after FWA war has ended and missing sync

We do not permit members to join CWL with an outside clan while remaining a member of 2.G. By doing so, you give up your spot with no guarantee one will be available later. Those leaving without notice/at the last minute will be banned from rejoining.

# How does the Strike System work?
Strikes are used by leadership to keep track of offenses. You will be notified in the [ws2g-strikes](https://discord.com/channels/659027277706821643/1069688242342985729) channel when you have been given a strike. Entering strikes is manual and they may be assigned any time after an offense is committed, usually within a few days. Strikes may be removed if the member reports and owns up to their mistake or when they have avoided receiving new strikes for 3 months.

The number of strikes given for a particular offense is based on the severity of the offense and the members previous record. You can see what strikes you have by entering any bot channel and using the command *!strikes*

Leadership reserves the right to remove any member for any reason, for example if they are deemed to be doing the bare minimum for multiple consecutive seasons, the member is not being a team player, or they're the least active member of their Town Hall level when the clan needs to adjust it's war weight. There is no hard number of strikes that will trigger immediate removal from the clan.
