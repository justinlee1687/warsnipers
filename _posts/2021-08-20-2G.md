# What is expected of me as a member of the clan?

### 1. All Members must donate and receive a combined total of 3000 troops per season.
{:.no_toc}
- Troops requested for attacks **AND** donated to clanmates count toward this total.
  - Clashperks <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">/donations</span> command in #ws2g-bot will be used to determine your stats each season.
- **We do not enforce any Donation/Request ratio.** All members are encouraged to request as much as possible.
- If you request for any, you may receive any unit, including ones you may not want.

Members doing the bare minimum to remain in the clan may, at the discretion of leadership, be removed from the clan at any time if a spot needs to be opened up.
{: .notice--info}

### 2. Must use ALL Clan Capital attacks during the Raid Weekend.
{:.no_toc}
+ **Members must finish attacking a district before starting a new one.** Never leave a district at a high percentage if you have attacks remaining, **clean up your mess.**
+ Members with alts may join to use attacks in the last **24 hours** of the Raid Weekend.

If other players are online attacking districts, coordinate with them in chat. Always ask before attacking a district someone else has started.
{: .notice--info}

### 3. Must use both attacks in FWA wars as directed by the clan mail.
{:.no_toc}
+ **Attack your mirror within the first 16 hours of war day.**
	- Always check the clan mails and **scout the opponents base** before attacking.
	- After 16 hours have elapsed, you are considered late and your mirror can be claimed by any other member.
	- If you've logged in late and your mirror has been attacked, use your first attack on a base that has not already been cleared for **3 stars** (*in a win*) or **2 stars** (*in a loss*), then loot or cleanup with your second attack as normal.
		- If all bases have been cleared, *attack your mirror anyway*.
		- <span style="color:#B22222; font-weight:bold">Never attack 1 & 2.</span> Doing so without permission is grounds for immediate removal from the clan.		
+ **Cleanup time starts at the 8 hours remaining mark**
	- At this time, you may use your second attack on a base that has not already been cleared for **3 stars** (*in a win*) or **2 stars** (*in a loss*)
	- The mirrors of co/lead filler accounts and members who have been kicked from the clan may be cleaned up **at any time**.

### 3a. Make sure you use a proper strategy when attacking for 3 stars
{:.no_toc}
- You may receive a warning or strike if you fail your mirror attack repeatedly without notifying a co or the lead.
- If you're unsure how to 3 star a FWA base effectively and efficiently, watch your other clanmates replays, and if necessary, request a friendly challenge so you can practice.

### 4. Must earn a minimum of 500 points from the monthly Clan Games.
{:.no_toc}

### 5. Must notify leadership BEFORE leaving the clan or going inactive.
{:.no_toc}
+ Regardless of reason, you must notify leadership in a DM (Direct Message) to the Leader **at least 2 days in advance.**
	- The maximum amount of time you may be inactive without losing your spot is **10 days**. If you have not given notice within this time, you may be removed from the clan at any time and without further warning.
	- If you leave the clan to join another without giving notice, you will not be able to rejoin the clan quickly later, and may be banned from rejoining entirely.

### 6. Exercise 'Common Sense'
{:.no_toc}
+ Do not donate to the war clan castles or switch to a real war base during FWA wars or CWL.
+ Do not 3 star in loss wars or take full stars from another members mirror before cleanup time.
+ Do not use game modifications or external tools/bots on your account.
+ Do not use online services like 'cheap gem' sellers, account boosters, or similar services.
+ Do not try to buy or sell game accounts through any clan chats.
+ Do not share access to your Clash of Clans account or Discord account with anyone, even friends or family. You are responsible for any actions taken through your account.
+ Do not share links or details of ToS breaking activity in any clan chats.
+ Remain civil and avoid using excessive amounts of vulgar language when interacting with your clanmates.

# I want to participate in SCCWL, where and how can I do that?
Our clan works with a few other clans in our discord to organize CWL in new separate clans. This allows us to run Lazy CWL at the same time as our FWA wars. Spots in CWL are first come, first served. Details will be announced by @Justin in the ws2g-announcements channel on Discord. Enabling push notifications for that channel is recommended.

Interested members must thoroughly read the following document: [CWL Guidelines and Frequently Asked Questions](/cwl "You agree to follow these rules whether you have read them or not" ). Once the announcement has been posted, you will need to join one of the clans in the message within 24 hours of it being posted. Throughout the week, you will hop to your CWL clan (Bookmark it!) for attacks then immediately return to the main clan.

CWL participation is an optional perk for clan members, but it is also a privilege. Members may be banned from CWL or removed from the clan for any of the following reasons:
- Joining but not attacking in CWL, leading to a wasted spot
- Lingering excessively in the CWL clan
- Attacking improperly in CWL
- Having a REAL war base set at any time
- Leaving for CWL after FWA war has ended and missing sync

Members who wish to do CWL with an outside clan will have to give up their spot and reapply. There is no guarantee that you will be able to get back into one of our clans right away following the end of CWL, especially if you demonstrate that you will leave every season.
