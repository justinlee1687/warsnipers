# What is expected of me as a member of the clan?

### 1. All Members must donate a minimum of 1000 troops and receive a minimum of 1000 troops per season.
{:.no_toc}
- Clashperks <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">/donations</span> command in #ws2g-bot will be used to determine your stats each season.
- **Please be specific with your troop requests.** If you do not want to request a specific composition, please list a selection of troops you can use or ask for '<span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">Any Ground</span>' or '<span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">Any Air</span>'. If at all possible, please do not request just any! If you choose to do so, you may receive any unit, even ones you may not want.
- **We do not enforce any Donation/Request ratio.** All members are encouraged to request as much as possible, and should avoid using raid medals except when no one else is online or you need to bypass the request cooldown.

Minimums are intended to be exceeded, Leadership reserves the right to remove any member who is only doing the bare minimum should the clan need to adjust its war weight or open up a spot.
{: .notice--info}

### 2. Must use ALL Clan Capital attacks during the Raid Weekend.
{:.no_toc}
+ Elders may bring in alts temporarily to contribute capital gold at any time, but may not use any attacks until the last **24 hours** of the Raid Weekend to give everyone a fair chance to attack.
+ Use of the Forge is appreciated, but *NOT REQUIRED*.

If other players are online attacking districts, please call out your attacks. Only attack a district that has been hit already if no one in chat is planning to finish it. If in doubt, <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-style:italic">ask, dont snipe</span>.
{: .notice--info}

### 3. Must earn a minimum of 500 points from the monthly Clan Games.
{:.no_toc}
### 4. Must use both attacks in FWA wars as directed by the clan mail.
{:.no_toc}
+  **On a win war:**
	- **First Attack:** *Three star your mirror*
	- **Second Attack:** *Loot any base for 1 or 2 stars* **OR** See Cleanup ðŸ”½
	- **Cleanup (8h or less remaining):** *With your Second Attack, three star any base that has not already been 3 starred*
+  **On a loss war:**
	- **First Attack:** *Two star your mirror*
	- **Second Attack:** *Loot any base for 1 star* **OR** See Cleanup ðŸ”½
	- **Cleanup (8h or less remaining):** *With your Second Attack, two star any base that has not already been 2 starred*
+ The mirrors of filler accounts and members who have been kicked from the clan are available for cleanup at any time.
+ **If you are attacking late** (*Less than 8h remaining*) **and your mirror has already been cleared:**
	- Use your first attack on a base that has not already been cleared for **3 stars** (*in a win*) or **2 stars** (*in a loss*), then loot or cleanup with your second attack as normal.
		- If all bases have been cleared, *attack your mirror anyway*.
+ <span style="color:#B22222; font-weight:bold">Never attack 1 & 2</span>, you will be kicked immediately.

### 4a. Make sure you use a proper strategy when attacking for 3 stars
{:.no_toc}
- You may receive a warning or strike if you fail your mirror attack repeatedly without notifying the leader.
- If you're unsure how to 3 star a FWA base effectively and efficiently, watch your other clanmates replays, and if necessary, request a friendly challenge so you can practice.

### 4b. On a Non-FWA war (*Blacklisted clan or Mismatch*):
{:.no_toc}
- A notice with instructions and guides for war bases, war clan castle troop compositions, and attacking strategies will be posted in #ws2g-announcement.
- **On Prep Day:** Follow all instructions and switch to a war base ASAP. If you have max troops available, assist in filling war clan castles.
- **On War Day:** Immediately switch your war base back to FWA. Use both attacks as directed for your TH level or base number.

### 5. Must notify leadership BEFORE leaving the clan or going inactive.
{:.no_toc}
+ Regardless of reason, you must notify leadership in a DM (Direct Message) to the Leader **at least 2 days in advance.**
	- The maximum amount of time you may be inactive without losing your spot is **10 days**. If you have not given notice within this time, you may be removed from the clan at any time and without further warning.
	- If you leave the clan to join another without giving notice, you will not be able to rejoin the clan quickly later, and may be banned from rejoining entirely.

### 6. Exercise 'Common Sense'
{:.no_toc}
+ Do not donate to the war clan castles or switch to a real war base during FWA wars or CWL.
+ Do not 3 star in loss wars or take full stars from another members mirror before cleanup time.
+ Do not use game modifications or external tools/bots on your account.
+ Do not use online services like 'cheap gem' sellers, account boosters, or similar, as they often steal accounts and run off with money.
+ Do not try to buy or sell game accounts through any clan chats.
+ Do not share access to your Clash of Clans account or Discord account with anyone, even friends or family. You are responsible for any actions taken through your account.
+ Do not share links or details of ToS breaking activity in any clan chats.
+ Remain civil and avoid using excessive amounts of vulgar language when interacting with your clanmates.

# I want to participate in SCCWL, where and how can I do that?
Our clan works with a few other clans in our discord to organize CWL in new separate clans. This allows us to run Lazy CWL at the same time as our FWA wars. Spots in CWL are first come, first served. Details will be announced by @Justin in the ws2g-announcements channel on Discord. Enabling push notifications for that channel is recommended.

Interested members must thoroughly read the following document: [CWL Guidelines and Frequently Asked Questions](/cwl "You agree to follow these rules whether you have read them or not" ). Once the announcement has been posted, you will need to join one of the clans in the message within 24 hours of it being posted. Throughout the week, you will hop to your CWL clan (Bookmark it!) for attacks then immediately return to the main clan.

CWL participation is an optional perk for clan members, but it is also a privilege. Members may be banned from CWL or removed from the clan for any of the following reasons:
- Joining but not attacking in CWL, leading to a wasted spot
- Lingering excessively in the CWL clan
- Attacking improperly in CWL
- Having a REAL war base set at any time
- Leaving for CWL after FWA war has ended and missing sync

Members who wish to do CWL with an outside clan will have to give up their spot and reapply. There is no guarantee that you will be able to get back into one of our clans right away following the end of CWL, especially if you demonstrate that you will leave every season.
