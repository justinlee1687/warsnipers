## Instructions:
1. You join the CWL clan
2. I start war, and you will head back to your main clan once we've started CWL.
3. You stay put in the main clan at all times, except for CWL attacks. It is important to do so as we will do FWA wars alongside CWL.
4. You jump to the CWL clan, do your attack and head straight back to your home clan.
5. Steps 3 to 4 will be repeated 7 times.

## Guidelines:
1. We will be doing CWL and regular FWA wars at the same time so you need to <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-weight:bold"> keep your FWA war base active AT ALL TIME </span> - If you got a WAR BASE in FWA that is a INSTANT KICK
2. <span style="color:#3fa63f; font-weight:bold"> Do NOT linger in the CWL clan unnecessarily.</span> Hop over to attack and return to your main clan immediately. *You should not take more than 10 minutes.*
3. *Attack your mirror*; you may only attack another base if the owner has already attacked it , if you've made an agreement with the base owner,  or if the base is open for everyone(The free bases will be pinned in the clan specific CWL channel.)
Please let a leader know if your target was taken and you’re confused on what to do.
4. **Be prepared before leaving.** Make sure you have clan castle troops, your full army trained, and heroes healed, before going.
5. Turn your INVITES ON, so we can send you invites back.
6. Bookmark your CWL clan so you do not get lost.
7. Tag a Leader in your clan specific chat if you cannot request into the clan. This means when you request, the “Request Sent” message does not show up. This happens because there can be only 5 sitting requests at any one time.
8. Request back into the FWA clan with “returning from CWL” for quicker and easier hopping.

Do **NOT** leave from the main clan between end of CWL signups & start of FWA war, and between end of FWA war day and start of the next FWA sync. Occasionally, CWL clans will be closed to indicate you should not leave.

> Leaders reserve the right to ban anyone from CWL or forbid you from getting the bonus.<br>
> Common reasons include but are not limited to:<br>
> - Joining but not attacking in CWL, leading to a wasted spot.<br>
> - Taking too long to come back from CWL.<br>
> - Missing FWA attacks while not missing CWL attacks.
> - Going over to the CWL clan without finishing your FWA attacks if instructed to do so.

## FAQs:
**Q: Do we face war bases or FWA bases in CWL?** <br>
A: War Bases

**Q: My mirror is never the same TH level as me, I need help!** <br>
A: Please read the message in our discord here (a pin in #clash-chat) or click [here](https://www.warsnipers.com/cwl.html#a-simple-guide-to-2-starring-bases-that-are-above-your-normal-th-level-mostly-for-cwl)

**Q: How do I get the bonuses?** <br>
A: This is clan dependent. Some clans give it to highest donors, some give it out randomly. 2.8, 2.B, 2.D, 2.G and 2.A uses a more complicated system. The standard deviation of all clan members is calculated using last month’s donation and receives, with proportion to their TH level and their total clan statistics . Donations are weighted twice as heavily as receives during this calculation. Then, it is given to the ones with the highest z score in each CWL clan.

**Q: Can I have a war base? I’ll remember to change my base.** <br>
A: No. No exceptions. FWA base at all times. (Clan-wide exceptions do apply if we match a blacklisted clan)

**Q: Do we ever win? What’s the point of losing all the CWLs?** <br>
A: We do occasionally win. We earn a decent number of medals just by losing, see “How many medals will I get?”.

**Q: Can my mini/alt account join your CWL?** <br>
A: You may add an alt into the last CWL clan listed on discord. I do not make guarantees on whether we can start or if you will be in war. Please state you are adding an alt account on discord so I do not boot you for a random player.

**Q: Can I have a mini in the clan to scout bases?** <br>
A: Yes, but please add the account AFTER we’ve started CWL, as you will mess up the CWL count. You will need to ask for a promotion on discord once we’ve started CWL, as the new update prohibits non-participating members to scout.

**Q: How do I know when war starts?** <br>
A: We have currently implemented a bot to check CWL times. See the CWL category on discord for your clan specific CWL channel. See the pinned message in the channel for the commands.

**Q: How do you do both FWA and CWL together, won’t there be a war timer?** <br>
A: No. CWL war timer is separate from regular war timers.

**Q: How do you track donations when we hop to CWL everyday?** <br>
A: see /donations in clan bot channel, but you should be able to hit your clan minimums d/r regardless with d/r from end of CWL to end of season. It’s not that difficult.

**Q: How do I maximize medals?** <br>
A: You should get at least 8 stars during the entire CWL. See table below for further details.

| Numbers of Stars Earned | Percentage of Medals Earned |
|:-----------------------:|:---------------------------:|
| 0                       | 20%                         |

| 8+                      | 100%                        |

**Q: How many medals will I get?**

## A simple guide to 2 starring bases that are above your normal TH level (mostly for CWL):

Writing a big note especially for the lower townhall players having difficulty in getting stars in CWL. I am attaching 2 replays on the best strategy to be used for CWL. Most of the time you all would be able to score 2 stars in hitting a townhall which is higher than yours.

[11v13 2 stars strategy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAEFuLu-TILUOVQBExVzIpP9ET20C7sU/view?usp=drivesdk)

[11v12 2 stars strategy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q8B0AJ6pAONZVWfDyMFstSI36cWvZdLX/view?usp=drivesdK)

Points to remember:
1. You need to be calculative on destroying the air defense using zap spells. Try to get at least 3 ads with zap spells especially those ads which are farther from the center.
2. With this strategy you do not need to care about enemy cc or enemy heroes. No need to kill them.
3. If you have no heroes of your own, no worries. You really do not need bk and aq. Only when the townhall is in center, you need grand warden's ability on the blimp so that it reaches to the townhall otherwise even grand warden is not required.
4. You basically need only baby dragons and zap spell level to be high to have a higher success rate. Recommended level for baby drg is 4 and for zap spell is 7.

Other tricks to make sure your blimp gets to the TH:
- Use a hound to tank for your blimp, aka coco hounds.
- Don't bring a cc of pure sneaky gobs:
1. you can bring a couple of wbs (calculate how many wbs by death damage it takes to take down the wall around the TH, this is for in case you fall short and am one compartment away.
2. you can bring about 10-15 normal gobs, so they become the buffer for your sgobs in case you hit traps( esp tornado)
