***

The Raid Weekend is when Clans attack an enemy Clan Capital.

    The Leader and Co-Leader sign the Clan up for the Raid Weekend.
    Players sign up by attacking during the Raid Weekend.
    Up to 50 Clan members can join a Raid Weekend.
    Clans do not go head-to-head in Raids. Clans attack a different Clan than the one attacking them.
    It is possible to attack several Clan's Capitals in the same Raid Weekend.
