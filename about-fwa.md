What is the FWA ?

This means Farm War Alliance. The Farm War Alliance was created to allow farming clans to participate in arranged wars with the other farming clans that understand the farm war concept. We are an International group of over 600+ proud clans. We take turns winning and all have similar easy to 3 star bases. This allows our clans to gain considerable clan XP and loot.

The idea with our arranged wars is to get easy loot and stars, with a small army cost. Without all the stress of real wars. You can play casually, having your heroes upgrading. All the bases are built in a way to allow for easy 2 stars or 3 stars.

What is the design?

Basic outline of the FWA Base:

The base is split into FOUR SECTIONS.

1) Townhall Section

The TH section consists of all non-defensive buildings and air defenses and sweepers. The TH must be on the EDGE of the section and the eagle must be under the TH and on the edge. Eagle cannot be more than three buildings away from the TH.

**Please note that TH12/13s should have townhall and eagle/storages on OPPOSITE ENDS, refer to picture for more details.**

**TH 14 ONLY: Builder Huts regardless of level (with the exception of the master builder) placed together in the TH Section with a 6 tiles gap from any defense/building and accessible (as a group) from at least 3 sides.**

2) Trap Section

All traps must be ENCLOSED in walls. The walls cannot surround the TH or queen section. Walls must not form an offensive image, word or symbol. AIR traps cannot overlap the king section and GROUND traps cannot overlap the queen or TH section

3) Queen Section

The queen section must contain the teslas, wizard towers, archer towers, archer queen, grand warden, royal champion, infernos and scattershots. Infernos must be set to single. The infernos and queen must have ONE COMPLETE SIDE exposed. Scattershots must be side by side on the edge of the map. Teslas cannot be placed in front of the exposed side. A building directly next to an inferno or queen cannot be more than one square ahead of the queen or inferno. Walls must be away from the queen section allowing for troop deployment around the whole section.There must not be more than three buildings covered by walls.

4) King Section

The king section consists of cannons, mortars, xbows, bomb towers, clan castle and the barbarian king. Xbows must be set to ground.

⚠⚠The range of the defense buildings INCLUDING the cc cannot overlap any other section⚠⚠

⚠NO GAPS allowed in any section⚠
