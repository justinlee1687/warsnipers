Clan Level 28 #298VGUJ2
([Open In-Game](https://link.clashofclans.com/en?action=OpenClanProfile&tag=298VGUJ2)) ([Open Clash of Stats](https://www.clashofstats.com/clans/war-snipers-2.g-298VGUJ2/members/))

# What is expected of me as a member of the clan?

1. Must donate and request a total of 100 troops per week, adding up to 500 of each per season.

	-   **Be careful and read all requests before donating.** If you mistakenly donate a wrong troop, own up to it immediately. Accidents happen, but if you are doing so repeatedly and maliciously, you will be removed from the clan and possibly be unable to join any other War Snipers clan in our Discord.

	-   **If you receive a troop that is not in your request, report it immediately** - regardless of whether you can identify the donator. If it happens more than once, please bring it to the attention of a Leader in #ws2g-chat on Discord.

	-   **Please be specific with your troop requests.** If you do not wish to use the in-game feature to request a specific composition, you may list the troops you want or ask for “Any Ground” or “Any Air”. If at all possible, please do not request just any!

2. Must earn a minimum of 500 points from the monthly Clan Games.

3. Must follow war attacking instructions and attack as directed by the clan mail.

	+  **On a win war:**
		- **First Attack:** *Three star mirror*
		- **Second Attack:** *Loot any base for 1 or 2 stars* OR *Wait until 8 hours or less remain to cleanup for 3 stars*
		- **If attacking late (After 8h):** *Three star any base that has not already been 3 starred* OR If all bases have already been cleared, *Attack mirror for 3 stars anyway, loot as normal*

	+  **On a loss war:**
		- **First Attack:** *Two star mirror*
		- **Second Attack:** *Loot any base for 1 star* OR *Wait until 8 hours or less remain to cleanup for 2 stars*
		- **If attacking late (After 8h):** *Two star any base that has not already been 2 starred* OR If all bases have already been cleared, *Attack mirror for 2 stars anyway, loot as normal*

	+ **On a blacklisted or mismatched war:**
		- **Switch to war base** during Prep Day, **switch back to FWA** once War Day has started.
		- Use resources posted in the Discord Announcenents channel, if available.
		- **Use both attacks** to claim 2 or 3 stars from war bases as directed in the announcements channel.

	+ Failing war attacks due to disconnections will not be counted against you, however failing due to bringing an improper army will. If you're unsure how to 3 star a FWA base effectively and efficiently, watch your other clanmates replays, and if neccesary, request a friendly challenge so you can practice.
	- Repeatedly over or understarring may result in removal from the clan.
	
4. Must notify leadership if unable to play Clash for any period of time.

	+ Regardless of reason, you must notify leadership in #ws2g-chat on discord or in a DM (Direct Message) to the Leader, if you're more comfortable doing that.
		- Preferably, please give notice in advance if possible.
		- You may remain in the clan and will be excused if you will be or have been inactive for less than 10 days.
		- If you will be inactive for longer than 10 days, you may lose your spot.
		- If you have been inactive without notice for an extended period of time, you may be removed from the clan at any time, by the discretion of leadership.

	
# Who are the clans leaders and how can I reach them?
[Lead] WilliamLC (WilliamLC#8374), [Lead] Justin (Justin#1676), and [Co] Queen Do / Interesse (petervdb#0348)

The best way to contact leadership is to @ mention their Discord username in #ws2g-chat or message them directly.

This is the quickest way to get an answer to any questions you may have. Most messages in in-game chat will be missed.
